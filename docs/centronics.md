# Centronics-Interface (Parallel printer port)

![CENTRONICS-Interface](./CENTRONICS.png)

## Features
The original centronics interface (CENT) was a IOE(./ioe.md) card where one output port was used to send 8 bit parallel outout data, the second output port was used to send the STROBE signal and one input port was used to receive the BUSY signal from the printer.
A later version "CENT 2" was a dedicated card which added a logic to generate interrupts based on the ACK signal from the printer. This is currently not simulated.
The Centronics Interface is simulated using a binary file (binary to allow for special characters like escape sequences or formfeed instructions). The format may be dependent on the selected printer driver.

The following features are currently implemented:

1. All characters send to the centronics interface are written to a listing file with the ending ".lst".
2. The name of the listing file can be changed using the GUI button with a foto of the centronics connector. You can select any file with the ending ".lst". Currently you can not create a new file from the GUI, but you can easily create a empty file in your OS with the filetype of ".lst" and use it as a listing file. **ATTENTION!!!**: If the listing file already contains data, it will be overwritten, 

## Configuration

The following section of the configuration file is used to configure the printer file:

    - ListFile: ./list.lst

## Limitations

1. Files will be overwritten without any warning.
2. No new listing file can be created in the GUI.
3. Interrupts, like generated by the CENT 2 interface are currently not supported.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add support in the GUI to create new printout files (.lst).
2. Add interrupt support.
3. (Maybe) Generate a PDF file which simulates a printout on continuous stationery with green lines.
